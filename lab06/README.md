# North Carolina Important Bird Areas

This web map shows a selection of the Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in North Carolina, along with the number of species observed in each NC county.
[IBAs](https://www.audubon.org/important-bird-areas) are sites designated by Audubon to be of conservation concern on either the regional or global level.
Sites are categorized as priority for either the state, continent, or world (global).

The map features a basemap by CartoDB/Stamen, choropleth symbolization of county species, points for the IBAs, and a legend.
It is built using LeafletJS, icons from Font Awesome, and colors from Chroma JS.

The species data was taken from eBird.
The IBA points were generalized by hand from an online Audubon map; they are really areas of varying size.
